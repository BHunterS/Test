                                    to him I am grateful. His bedside manner and post-op care is tremendous. I would
                                    definitely recommend Dr. Smith to anyone anywhere. If ever I am in need for another
                                    surgery, I will not hesitate to go straight to Dr. Smith.</div>

                                    back surgeries that were only minimally effective. I was really in bad pain and I
                                    had been told that pills were my only option. Dr. Smith disagreed with the other
                                    doctors and I took a chance on a third surgery. I was scared but I did great and
                                    after three months, I am almost pain free – 90% better than I was. I am so very glad
                                    that Dr. Smith didn’t give up on me. I will always be grateful.</div>
